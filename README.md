This project showcases a simple yet engaging splash screen landing page created using pure HTML and CSS. Splash screens are often used as a welcoming page or loading screen for websites or applications to capture usersâ€™ attention or provide brand awareness before transitioning to the main content.

Features
Simple and Clean Design: A minimalistic splash screen with a logo or main text.
Transition Effects: Smooth fade-in and fade-out animations for a professional look.
Mobile Responsive: The splash screen is responsive, ensuring proper display on both desktop and mobile devices.
Customizable: Easily change text, logo, or background to suit different projects or brands

How It Works
The splash screen acts as a prelude before users access the main website or application content. This design ensures the initial page is visually appealing and can display a message, a brand logo, or an animation to engage users.
